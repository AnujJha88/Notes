You should know 
- PCA
- SVD
- Basic Classification Algos like KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, LogReg, Naive Bayes
- ANNs, Deep NNs etc.

We are going to look at algos in the context of scale so we have enormous data or features and how do we efficiently handle it 

We will also concentrate on graphs(not just GNNs).

Topics using some kind of structure in data and exploit it efficiently or build some structure and do the same or deal with scale to make some algos faster or efficient.

We will use tools from probability that leverage randomization to deal with scale. Make a randomized algo that makes choices that help us deal with scale.
